          <h1>Loch Ness Monster (cryptozoology)</h1>
          <h2>Published in 2023</h2>
          <p>
           The Loch Ness Monster is sometimes called by the shortname "Nessie."
           Nessie is a creature believed to live within a large freshwater lake in Scottish Highlands, known as the Lock Ness.
           The lake has murkey waters and speculation has surrounded it since as early as the 1930's, when many sightings were reported.
           This creature is referenced in various folklore and even religious texts.
           Despite proof claiming to show the creature, most have been discredited.
